    "body": "I have a curious mind and a passion for learning. Ever since I was young, I've been trying to figure out how things worked. I was lucky enough that my parents allowed me to have a Windows 98 computer in my room as a kid which did nothing but fuel my desire to learn everything I can about technology. I still remember my first program, a calculator I wrote in BASIC after I purchased my first laptop in middle school. That burning desire to learn has brought me to where I am, and is still burning ferociously to this day. In my free time, I am constantly developing software and playing with virtual machines. I'm lucky, the stuff I do for work is the same stuff I do for fun. Everything from machine learning, software development and system administration. It's all fun, and I love doing it."
